Record of feature finding in MZmine and molecular networking:
I. MzMine: 1. Raw data import <-raw data methods
2. Open one of the files to manually investigate
3. Processing wizard->  LC-MS workflow->choose mode and instrument
4. MS presets: -MS noise level: zoom in on actual sample and find where the noise is
               -MS2 noise level: choose several MS2 peaks from peak table (more intense and higher m/z) and check noise level 
               -min feature heigh: 3x higher than MS/noise level
5. HPLC presets: -ret. time: adjust to program
                 -max peaks in chromatogram: 10-15 (hom namy of the same peaks are in chromatogram)
                 -min samples per allign feature: depends on how many repeatable samples are in batch
                 -min # of data points: usually 4
                 -approx feature FWHM: check several goos peaks
                 -intra-sample RT tolerance
                 -inter-sample RT tolearnce
                 -features with 13C
