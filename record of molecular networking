MzMine: 1. Raw data import <-raw data methods
2. Open one of the files to manually investigate
3. Processing wizard->  LC-MS workflow->choose mode and instrument
4. MS presets: -MS noise level: zoom in on actual sample and find where the noise is
               -MS2 noise level: choose several MS2 peaks from peak table (more intense and higher m/z) and check noise level 
               -min feature heigh: 3x higher than MS/noise level
