Record of feature finding in MZmine and molecular networking:
I. MzMine: 1. Raw data import <-raw data methods
2. Open one of the files to manually investigate
3. Processing wizard->  LC-MS workflow->choose mode and instrument
4. MS presets: -MS noise level: zoom in on actual sample and find where the noise is
               -MS2 noise level: choose several MS2 peaks from peak table (more intense and higher m/z) and check noise level 
               -min feature heigh: 3x higher than MS/noise level
5. HPLC presets: -ret. time: adjust to program
                 -max peaks in chromatogram: 10-15 (hom namy of the same peaks are in chromatogram)
                 -min samples per allign feature: depends on how many repeatable samples are in batch
                 -min # of data points: usually 4
                 -approx feature FWHM: check several goos peaks
                 -intra-sample RT tolerance
                 -inter-sample RT tolearnce
                 -features with 13C 
6. Export->V->choose location, put a date in a name
7. Build batch->remove smoothing
                  -ion identity networking->ion identity library->setup->choose all adducts
*to make , for example, Fe3+:add->put mass monoisotopic->click combine->[M+Fe]+3 + [M-H]- + [M-H]- ->add->[M+Fe-2H]+

II. Molecular Networking-GNPS
  -Classical:only MS2 data, need to load mzMLfile additionally
  -Feature-based (FBMN): MS1+MS (perform MzMine feature finding beforehand)
FBMN requirement files:
  1. Feature table:.txt or .cvs (with intensities of LC-MS)
  2. .mgf file: MS2 spectral summary
  3. Metadata table (text(tab delimited))
            Metadata table format: open the resul file from feature finding (cvs)->copy all of mzML peak area names
->transpose->delete "_peak area"->filename
            Column 1: filename (xxx1.mzML, xxx2.mxML, ...)
            Column 2: Samplename (input actual sample names that were randomized for MS)
            Column 3-x: Attribute_shorthand (attribute:wt/mutant/media etc)
   ! Do both pos and neg modes.

GNPS submission:
Advanced Analysis Tool->Feature Networking->insert 3 files->basic options (0.02 Da tolerance for both)->
->Advanced Network Options(min pairs cos : 0.7, min mathced fr.ions:6)->normalization->
->PCoA Distance Metric: braycurtis (run dereplicator-annotates known Peptide Nat Products)->Submit
